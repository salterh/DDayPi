# DDayPi

## Spec 

An interactive timeloop soundscape which presents aural opportunities for participants to find clues and answer questions in interesting ways. Participants should listen closely to audio clues and pay attention to their surroundings to answer questions which meaningfully change the soundscape. Players must discover why this ship has become cursed; one of the ships builders dropped a locket in the engine.

### Puzzles

#### Handheld

A small, 3D printed device that has a small speaker, 4 buttons, and a UV LED. A morse code guide will be etched into the side.
The "Next" button will play the next audio file.
The "Prev" button will play the previous audio file.
The "Clue" button will play a clue depending on which audio file was last played.
The "Light" button will activate the UV LED.

#### Landing Bay

An LED strip will be visible from the landing bay, and will be flashing more code for "engine". 

#### Engine Room

This room will be dressed up to look more like a bar and dance floor. The lights will be covered with coloured acetate sheets. A makeshift bar will be installed over some of the controls already installed. On the bar, there will be posters which showcase lyrics to songs that will be playing. Each of the posters have a pose on them; players will have to match the pose on the poster that is matching the song currently playing.

#### Helm & Captain's Quarters

There will be a radio which is playing white noise. The players should change the frequencies until they hear a voice, which will tell them a series of paragraphs, letters, and words. In the Captain's Quarters there will be a letter. The players should identify the words: "call the date". The players will go to the rotary phone, input the date on the letter, which will reveal that a locket was lost.

#### Upper Deck

A map showing the UK will be visible inside a picture frame. Nearby is also a grid of flags. This grid will match a laminated grid that the players are given. Using a UV LED on the map will show coordinates, which will reveal, when used in conjunction with the grids, the location where the ship was built.
